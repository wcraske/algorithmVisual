# COMP359 - Assignment 2

William Craske's portion - a python based algorithm visualizer setup to display the A* algorithm. 
By implementing the python library tkinter, we are able to create a graphical interface which enables the user to creaet nodes and edges, then run the algorithm.  
A short tutorial, click "draw nodes" then place as many nodes as you want. the first node is the start node, and the last node is the goal node.
Clicking "draw edges" then pressing and holding your mouse to bring it to the nodes you'd like to connect connects them.
